# What do I want to achieve

# Weight loss
I want to lose weight to look good, to feel healthy and to be able to exercise more freely. I will do this by using **MyFitnesspal everyday** and making sure I don't go over the reccomend calorie intake.

I will also eat less
* chocolate
* energy drinks
* Meat

I want to eat less meat because it's unhealthy for you, in my opnion. I want to go complete vegeterian.
I will start by swapping meals at breakfast and dinner for vegeterian options before completely going vegeterian.

# Improve at coding
I want to improve at coding to enable me to one day change the world. I will do this by coding for at least an hour every 4 days in a week.

# Read more
I want to read more next year to improve my knowledge. I will try to read at least 50 pages per week, or 10 per day. I will document this here.

# Write more
I want to write more on my blog on Medium because it helps me achieve my life-time goal of helping others and providing free educational to all.

# Work out more
I want to work out more to be healthier, mentally healthier and to look good. I will go to Karate and work out at the gym more.

I will write a post every single day detailing how I'm doing in this format.
